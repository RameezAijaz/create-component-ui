# Runing Boilerplate

1. `cd` into project boilerplate.
2. Run `npm run watch` to start the webpack. It will create dist directory with the bundled code and keep watching for changes.
                            
                            OR
                            
3. Run `npm start` to start the webpack dev server. It will automatically open the home page of boilerplate in the browser.
4. Run `npm run build` to create the optimized, minified and production ready code inside `dist` directory.
